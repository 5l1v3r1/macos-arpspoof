#arpspoof for macOS

This repo extracts the arpspoof util from macOS fixed
[dsniff](https://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/) toolkit forked from [@ggreer](https://github.com/ggreer). The installing script itself is free, I
don't mind any commercial usage. And that means all the users should be fully
responsible to any consequences caused by using this script.

###Clone the sources

```BASH_SOURCE
git clone https://github.com/SuperMarcus/macos-arpspoof.git
cd macos-arpspoof
```

###Using the script

It's pretty convenient to use the `./build` script to compile and install the
program. But first of all you should make sure that you've got your
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed.

Run the following code to install Homebrew

```BASH_SOURCE
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

###Compiling

To compile the source, execute the following code

```BASH_SOURCE
./build build
```

The `./build` script supports custom compiler. If you want to use other
compilers, pass the path of the compiler as an argument like the following

```BASH_SOURCE
./build build "/usr/bin/gcc"
```

###Installing

The `./build` script can install the binary program and man page of the program.
Run the following commands

```BASH_SOURCE
./build install
```

If you would like to install the program to another place, pass the place you
want to install the program as an argument

```BASH_SOURCE
./build install ~/Desktop
```

Note that if you specified the custom location, man pages will not be installed

###Uninstalling

The `./build` script could help you uninstall the program when you no longer
need it

```BASH_SOURCE
./build uninstall
```
